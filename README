-----------------------------------------
To compile the client and server c files: 
-----------------------------------------
$ make 


---------------------------
To run the server:
---------------------------
$ ./tlsserver
$ ./tunserver.sh
Note: The server's certificate is ./cert_server/server-cert.pem, 
and the common name of the certificate is 'ashrithchandramouli.com'. 
Once the server program runs, the TUN interface is only created and needs to be brought up with an IP address.
Routing tables also need to be configured so that the server can accept connections to the TUN interface.
This is taken care of by the tunserver.sh which runs within the tunserver.c


---------------------------
To run the client:
---------------------------

Since the common name of the server's certificate is 'ashrithchandramouli.com', 
the hostname used by the client should match with this common name, or
the TLS connection will fail (this checking is implemented in the client 
program).  

First, add the following line to /etc/hosts, so the name 'ashrithchandramouli.com'
is mapped to your server's IP address (server_ip should be replaced by a 
real IP address):
 
server_ip     ashrithchandramouli.com
 
Now, we can run the client program (our server listens to port 4433).
Once the client program runs, the TUN interface is only created and needs to be brought up with an IP address.
Routing tables also need to be configured so that the client can easily contact the server.
This is taken care of by the tunclient.sh which runs within the tunclient.c
$ ./tlsclient ashrithchandramouli.com  4433

We have put two CA certificates in the ./ca_client folder: one is the 
CA that signs our server certificate, and the other is the CA that 
signs Google's certificate. Therefore, we can also use our client to
talk to Google's HTTPS server:

$ ./tlsclient www.google.com 443

See the instructions in the lab description if you want to use this client
program to talk to other HTTPS servers.
